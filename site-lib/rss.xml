While peaceful options exist, having to defend yourself is inevitable. Before combat begins in earnest, the order of turns made must be determined. This is done by using the AGI stat: the highest AGI character goes first, second highest goes second, etc. In the event of a tie, each character rolls one die to break the tie. In the event of an ambush, the ambushing party takes their turn first on the first round. Afterwards, normal turn order is determined. At the start of your turn, you replenish your AP: Action Points. Action Points are a resource that allow you to attack and defend in a variety of ways. By default, you gain 1 AP at the start of every turn, but some bonuses allow you to gain more. If you're at your AP Cap (normally 5), skip this step and take no AP. Afterward, you can choose to move in addition to one other command.You move along the combat grid an amount equal to or less than your movement speed. Your speed is determined by your race, plus any movement bonuses from AGI or equipment. You attack with an equipped weapon (or barehanded) against a target that's within range, spending 1 AP. The attacker and defender both roll a number of d6s, determined by the following:Attacker:STR *OR* AGI(Determined by weapon type) + Weapon Dice Value + Weapon Perks
Defender:STA *OR* AGI(Chosen by defender) + Armor Dice Value + Resistences
Additionally, both attacker and defender may spend AP to boost their roll, at the rate of 1AP per die. This must be done with the initial roll, and cannot be done after the dice have been thrown to change the result.The attacker and defender then pair their dice off. If the defender has more higher dice than the attacker, they successfully dodge or resist the attack. Otherwise, they take damage equal to the number of higher dice the attacker has. You cast a spell, spending the appropriate amount of AP required to do so (see individual spells for the amount of AP required.) When attacking with magic, the rolls are similar to when attacking with a weapon, but the stats used are different.Attacking:Base Spell Value + WIS + perks
Defending: Base Armor Value + WIS *OR* AGI + resistances See individual Support spells for how their effects are determined.You use an item out of your inventory. This costs no AP. You do nothing else this turn, and brace yourself. Defending in this manner doesn't cost AP, but prevents the AP replenishment step on your next turn. Adds one general defense die until your next turn (some perks may boost this). Some encounters may have objects that can be interacted with, such as levers or doors. Interacting with them usually will not require any kind of dice roll and don't by default use AP, but your DM may make special rules depending on the scenario. ]]></description><link>02-combat/01-combat-basics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">02 - Combat/01 - Combat Basics.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 23:53:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fire Spells]]></title><description><![CDATA[Fire Magic specializes in raw damage, and is surprisingly decent with healing, but lacks powerful defensive spells and doesn't have very many utility spells.

If you're a caster, this determines which element your character will have proficiency in casting. While it's possible to cast outside of your element, doing so is more difficult than sticking with your affinity. There are pros and cons to consider, whether you specialize in your element or decide to pick up a few spells outside of it. Spells are distributed between Assault and Support categories. Inside each category, spells are further distributed between ranks. So for example, a basic attack spell will be Assault, Rank 1. Classes gain access to these groups of spells at different paces! Check your class guide for more info (coming soon.)Each time you level up, you can choose to learn a spell (or technique, covered elsewhere in this manual) which you qualify for. Once a spell is 'learned,' you do not need to make a save to see if the spell is successfully cast. However, you can choose to attempt to cast a spell you don't currently have mastered (provided it's within a rank you have access to), but that you know about. This requires a save, with bonuses or penalties depending on the spell, its difficulty, and your knowledge of it. Additionally, remember to apply a -1 die penalty if the spell is not inside of your elemental affinity. The caster can also spend AP to add additional die to this roll, in order to simulate dumping extra mana into its cast to stabilize the spell. The AP must be used on the initial roll and cannot be used to pad a failed roll after the fact. On a failed spell cast, the caster suffers magical backlash. Even spells intended to have beneficial effects (like healing or shields) may explode or have other unintended effects if the spell fails. Some spells may have special failure effects; check individual spells to see if they list this. <img alt="failed.jpg" src="failed.jpg" target="_self">]]></description><link>03-magic/01-magic-basics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">03 - Magic/01 - Magic Basics.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 20:48:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="failed.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="failed.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[01 - Stats]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stats determine what your character is good at, on a very basic level.

Dark Elf: The most reclusive of the elf races, Dark Elves live in dense mountain forests away from other settlements.

Wood Elf:
Though secluded, these elves tend to be among the easiest to get along with. They enjoy the wilderness, live simpler lives, and even the company of monsters.
